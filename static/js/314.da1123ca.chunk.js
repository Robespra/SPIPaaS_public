There are also lots of cafes, bars and restaurants where you can shake off the exhaustion of the day. On Sundays, there are many parks where you can enjoy nature or listen to pianists from around the world playing Chopin.</p>\n        <p>For museum lovers, you can add these to your list:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>POLIN</li>\n            <li>Warsaw Uprising Museum</li>\n            <li>Fryderyk Chopin Museum</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h3>Next destination</h3>\n        <p>We will go to Berlin and have a night\'s walk in the city that never sleeps!
